### Generating a Proof
The proof generation process follows a structured search strategy, attempting multiple times to construct a valid proof. 
- It begins by organizing the available data into a structured format that allows efficient exploration. 
- At each attempt, the process systematically assigns elements into specific groups and explores different possibilities using a depth-first search approach. 
- The search progressively builds a candidate proof by selecting elements according to predefined rules. 
- If a complete and valid proof sequence is found, it is returned immediately. Otherwise, the search continues, testing alternative paths. 
- If no valid proof is discovered after all attempts, the process concludes without success.

### Verifying a Proof
The proof verification process ensures that a given proof is valid by checking its structure, consistency, and correctness. 
- It begins by confirming that the proof meets predefined constraints, including limits on the number of searches and retries, as well as ensuring that the proof contains the expected number of elements. 
- If any of these checks fail, the proof is immediately rejected. 
- The process then reconstructs a reference structure based on the proof's metadata and attempts to align it with the provided sequence. 
- Each element in the proof is examined to verify that it was selected correctly. 
- If any element does not align with expectations, the proof is deemed invalid. 
- Finally, a probabilistic check is applied to determine whether the proof meets the required security conditions. 
- If all verification steps pass, the proof is accepted; otherwise, it is rejected.

## Organization
This section is structured to maintain modularity, readability, and efficient navigation of the **Centralized Telescope** proof system. 
Each functional component; proof generation, verification, internal logic, hash functions, and parameters is organized into separate modules to ensure clarity and prevent redundancy.

- [Prove][crate::docs::centralized::proof::prove]:
  - Handles proof generation by integrating internal functions to systematically construct a proof.
  - Manages retries, binning, and DFS-based exploration to efficiently search for a valid proof.
- [Verify][crate::docs::centralized::proof::verify]:
  - Ensures proof correctness by reconstructing the round, verifying element consistency, and performing probabilistic validation.
- [Internal functions][crate::docs::centralized::proof::internal_functions]:
  - Contains core search logic such as `prove_index` and `dfs`. 
  - Structures the dataset into bins and explores proof sequences.
  - Prevents `prove` function from being cluttered with low-level details.
- [Hash functions][crate::docs::centralized::proof::hash_functions]:
  - Defines `bin_hash`, `round_hash`, and `proof_hash`, which are used to assign elements, generate candidate rounds, and validate proofs probabilistically.
- [Variables][crate::docs::centralized::proof::variables]:
  - Lists key data structures such as `params`, `round`, and `proof`, serving as a reference for understanding algorithm constraints.

### How to navigate?
- Understanding proof generation:
  - Begin with [$\mathsf{prove}$][crate::docs::centralized::proof::prove] to see the overall structure of proof construction.
  - Follow its call to [$\mathsf{prove\\_index}$][crate::docs::centralized::proof::internal_functions#prove-index], which organizes data and initiates the proof search.
  - Trace the execution of [$\mathsf{dfs}$][crate::docs::centralized::proof::internal_functions#dfs], which performs the depth-first search for a valid proof sequence.
  - Refer to [hash functions][crate::docs::centralized::proof::hash_functions] for details on element binning, round selection, and proof validation.
  - Check [variables][crate::docs::centralized::proof::variables] to understand parameter roles in proof generation.
- Understanding proof verification:
  - Analyze [$\mathsf{verify}$][crate::docs::centralized::proof::verify] to see how a proof is validated.
  - Cross-reference [hash functions][crate::docs::centralized::proof::hash_functions] to understand how proof correctness is checked.
  - Use [variables][crate::docs::centralized::proof::variables] to see how constraints affect verification.
