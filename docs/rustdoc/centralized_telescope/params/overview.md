# Centralized Telescope - Parameter Setup

The parameter setup ensures that the **DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithm** completes in a reasonable number of steps, even when the number of elements, $n_p$, is small.
- The scheme must handle both large and small $n_p$ efficiently while keeping proof generation practical.
- The goal is to **balance the prover's workload and the reliability of the proof**.
