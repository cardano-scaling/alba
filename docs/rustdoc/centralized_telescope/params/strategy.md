## Parameter selection strategy
- When $n_p$ is large:
    - If $n_p$ is at least $\lambda^3$, proof generation is straightforward.
    - The prover can find a valid proof in roughly the time it takes to process all elements.
    - The worst case, where the prover needs extra work, still remains within a manageable margin.
- When $n_p$ is small:
    - If $n_p < \lambda^3$, the standard approach no longer guarantees that the prover finds a valid proof quickly.
    - To fix this, we allow the prover to retry multiple times, increasing the chances of success without overwhelming computational cost.
    - Extra retries increase reliability, but they must be controlled to avoid unnecessary work.
- Handling intermediate cases ($\lambda^2 < n_p < \lambda^3$):
    - A hybrid strategy balances efficiency and reliability.
    - The prover makes more retries than in the large $n_p$ case but fewer than in the small $n_p$ case.
    - This keeps the average workload low while ensuring the proof remains trustworthy and compact.
- Keeping proof size practical:
    - The number of elements included in the proof remains almost unchanged, ensuring that verification remains efficient.
    - Security adjustments are made to prevent the prover from taking shortcuts that might compromise reliability.
- Preventing unbounded search:
    - Without restrictions, DFS could explore too many possibilities before finding a valid proof.
    - We limit the depth of the search, forcing it to stop early.
    - This ensures that even in the worst case, the prover finishes within a predictable time frame.
